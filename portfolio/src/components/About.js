            <p>I'm a FullStack Web Developer based out of the United States. I have a QA background in the BPO industry, and I am in the finishing stages of my Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas San Antonio! Becoming a Web Developer has been one of the most trying, frustrating, fun, exciting, and worth it experiences of my life! I've developed a skill that has allowed me to be a creator, true problem solver, and at the same time will open many new opportunities and doors for me! I am more than excited to make this career transition into the tech industry! Feel free to take a look at my resume, skills, and projects!</p>
